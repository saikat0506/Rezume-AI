## User Manual

Follow these steps to set up and use the AI Resume Tailor locally.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
* **Google Gemini API Key**: You'll need an API key from the Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

## 2. Local Setup

To run the application on your local machine:

### Step 2.1: Clone the Repository

First, clone your project repository from GitHub (or wherever you've hosted it) to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd your-resume-tailor-app/ # Navigate into your project directory

(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository and `your-resume-tailor-app/` with your project's folder name).

**Step 2.2: Install Dependencies**

Install all the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2.3: Set Your Gemini API Key**

Your application requires a Gemini API key. For local testing, you need to set this as an environment variable in your terminal *before* running the app.

  * **On Linux/macOS (or Git Bash on Windows):**
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
  * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
  * **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```cmd
    set GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

**Important:** Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your real Gemini API key. Ensure there are no spaces around the `=` sign.

**Step 2.4: Run the Application**

After setting the API key in the *same* terminal session, start the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

### 3\. How to Use the AI Resume Tailor

Once the application is running in your browser:

**Step 3.1: Upload Your Resume**

  * Click the "Browse files" button under "Upload your Resume (TXT or PDF file)".
  * Select your resume file. The app supports both plain text (`.txt`) and PDF (`.pdf`) formats.

**Step 3.2: Enter Job Title**

  * In the "Job Title" text box, type the exact title of the job you are applying for (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer", "Marketing Specialist").

**Step 3.3: Enter Job Description**

  * In the "Job Description" text area, paste the complete job description from the job posting. The more detailed it is, the better the AI can tailor your resume.

**Step 3.4: Choose Tailoring Style**

  * Select your preferred "Tailoring Style" from the dropdown menu:
      * **Standard:** Provides a balanced set of changes.
      * **Concise:** Focuses on brevity and the most critical information.
      * **Detailed:** Offers more elaborate and comprehensive modifications.

**Step 3.5: Tailor Your Resume**

  * Click the "Tailor My Resume üöÄ" button.
  * The app will display a spinner indicating that the AI is working. This process might take a few moments.

**Step 3.6: Review Results**

Once the process is complete, you will see three main sections:

  * **Your Tailored Resume üéâ:** This is the AI-generated version of your resume, optimized for the job description.
  * **Changes Highlighted üîç:** This section visually compares your original resume with the tailored version.
      * Text highlighted in **green** indicates additions made by the AI.
      * Text highlighted in **red** indicates deletions made by the AI.
  * **Resume Review & ATS Score üìä:**
      * **ATS Compatibility Score:** A score out of 100 indicating how well your resume is optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
      * **Humanized Review:** A detailed review from the perspective of a human recruiter, offering insights into readability, impact, and suggestions for further improvement.

**Step 3.7: Download Tailored Resume**

  * Click the "Download Tailored Resume" button to save the AI-generated resume as a `.txt` file to your computer.
